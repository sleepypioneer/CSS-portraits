# Drawing Shapes with CSS

"There are others we can create with CSS, but most things can be simplified to some combination of these shapes. And these are the easiest to create and manipulate."

## Multiples of the same shape
With multiple box-shadows, we can create many versions of the same shape in varying size, color, and blur. Offsetting them on the x- and y-axes gives us almost endless multiples.

multiple box-shadows

`div {  
    box-shadow: 170px 0 10px yellow,  
                330px 0 0 -20px blue,  
                330px 5px 5px -20px black;  
}`

We can even give our box-shadows box-shadows. Pay attention to the order they are declared. 
Again, It’s helpful to think of them as layers.
